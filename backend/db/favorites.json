When the cranberries begin to burst, lower the heat to medium-low and add the oats, stirring occasionally until the desired consistency is reached, about 5-7 minutes. When oatmeal is cooked, remove the ginger and cinnamon stick and add salt.Meanwhile, heat a small skillet over medium-low heat and add hazelnuts. Toast in the pan until you can smell the hazelnuts, as this means they are releasing their oils. Turn off heat and add hazelnuts to the oatmeal."
